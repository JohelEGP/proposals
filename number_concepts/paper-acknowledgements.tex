\rSec0[paper.ack]{Acknowledgements}

\pnum
I'd like to thank Mateusz Pusz for encouraging me to write a paper about this number concepts library.

\pnum
I'd also like to thank him and the other reviewers of \hrefVII{} for their stimulating feedback.
It has brought back memories of the mostly unwritten history, design and evolution of this library.

\pnum
All the advertised improvements over previous works
is thanks to the existence of \refp{1813} and its feedback by \refp{2402} and \hrefVI{}.
So thank you to everyone involved on those for making this possible.
